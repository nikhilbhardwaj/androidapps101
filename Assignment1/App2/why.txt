Note: The minimum required SDK version for this is 11. This is because the NumberPicker widget is available since api 11. I could have used a text box instead but I feel that this is a much better and more intuitive component for this use case.

What does your app do?
LuckySeven is a number guessing game. You guess the sum of two dice rolls.

Why did you decide to build the app?
I thought it was simple enough for me to implement and fun too.

What do you remember most about your development experience? 
The fun part was gluing together all the components. The UI components with java code.

What would you like to do next to your app?
I would like to implement scoring to see how well the user does and also implement a biased dice that makes the game harder or easier depending on how the user has done.
